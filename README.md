 # Intelligent Log Classification System

# ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a hybrid log classification system that combines rule-based, machine learning, and large language model (LLM) techniques to accurately classify system and application log messages into predefined categories.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Automatically classify log messages from various sources such as CRM systems and APIs.
Improve classification accuracy using regex, BERT-based ML, and LLMs for fallback.
Support easy integration and model extensibility for production pipelines.
# ðŸ§  Components
1. training.py

Reads a CSV dataset of synthetic logs.
Uses the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 SentenceTransformer to embed log messages.
Applies DBSCAN clustering to group similar log messages.
Uses regular expressions to classify known patterns.
Trains a Logistic Regression model on unlabeled and non-legacy logs.
Saves the trained model (log_classifier.joblib) for future inference.
2. process.py

Uses a Large Language Model (e.g., deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) via the Groq API.
Classifies complex/unstructured logs into categories like Workflow Error or Deprecation Warning using prompts and pattern matching.
3. process_bart.py

Loads the trained sentence embedding model and the Logistic Regression classifier.
Provides a function classify_with_bert() to predict log categories.
Returns "Unclassified" for low-confidence predictions (< 0.5 probability).
4. process_ragx.py

Implements classify_with_regex() using regex rules for known log message formats.
Categories include: User Action, System Notification, etc.
5. clarify.py

Main controller script.
Dynamically routes log messages through:
LLM for LegacyCRM source logs.
Regex first, then ML fallback for other sources.
Contains classify_csv() to process a CSV and save classified output.
ðŸ“‚ Example Usage
python clarify.py
Processes test.csv logs and outputs output.csv with classified labels.
